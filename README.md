## Integrated Tools to GitHub

- Codacy

## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1. GCC error in windows and linux: installed the gcc msys64 mingw64 properly.

2. Generation of makefile: To overcome this problem research on makefiles was done.

3. Unity testing: Initially a few testcases did not pass, to overcome this issue debugging of program was performed.
